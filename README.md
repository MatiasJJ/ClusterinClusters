# ClusterinClusters

> Welcome to use `Clusterin'Clusters` -code! It is a program for automated Structure Selection using k-means clustering algorithm.

> We assume you have just created a whole lot of structures with XTB and now your face looks like:
```

> Do not worry, but read on how to get from 10k structures to less that hundred relevant structures.

## Structure Selection
In configurational sampling procedure structure selection is used to reduce the amount of calculation for the next level of theory -step. This can be achieved simply by discarding some structures from the process. `ClusterinClusters` uses [k-means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) clustering for determining which structures are similar to each other. Similarity measure is Euclidian distance by default. The structures are represented as descriptors generated by the [`DScribe`-library](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/).

## Usage:
**Standalone:**
1. Make input data in same format than the example files (or edit the `read_data()`-function in `dataio.py` to fit your data)
1. Edit the parameter input in `input4Clustering.csv`. See below for further parameter details.
1. Run `StructureSelection.py`
1. See selected structures in SelectedXXX.csv

**In JKCS**
1. Run JKCS up to part 4.
1. *Run `JKCS5_filter` with some option?*

## Input parameters
The settings for `StructureSelection.py` can be edited by editing the values in `input4Clustering.csv`.

## Main program
The main program performs all the functionalities of ClusterinClusters by calling the functions from the modules. It reads in the values `input4Clustering.csv` and passes them on to the functions as parameters.

### Outputs
The user can choose verbose on/off in `input4Clustering.csv` parameter `v` by providing `True`/`False`.

#### Plots
The program creates a folder "`plots`" for visual representation of descriptors and clustering results. User can choose not to plot descriptors or clustering with the parameters `pd` and `pc` respectively.

Clustering results are visualised using [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) and plotted both in 2D and in interactive 3D plot (`.html`) that can be opened in a browser.
**Note:** t-SNE is a rather greedy algorithm so if there's thousands of structures or time is of the essence then `pc`=`False` is recommended.

#### Selected Structures
The structures are selected from the clustering results. The code calculates mean energies for each k-means cluster and prefers the clusters with smallest mean energies. Parameter `c` defines how many of $k$ clusters are selected. If random sampling is not used, all structures that belong to the selected clusters are outputted. Random sampling takes a sample of structures from the selected clusters and outputs them. Parameter `r` defines whether random sampling is used and parameter `s` defines the size of the sample *ie.* the number of structures outputted. Random sampling is recommended when saving time and calculation resources is of interest.

The list of selected structures is outputted as `selectedXXX.csv`.

## Modules

### `dataio.py`

This module is used for reading in the data.

| function | description     |
| :-------------- | :------------- |
| makedir()       | This function is used inside `init_files()` to create a folder if it does not exist. |
| init_files()    | This function creates a folder for plots inside the `wrkdir` |
| read_data()     | This function reads in the data from `JKCS` output. It needs the `level` parameter defined correctly. |
| read_xyz()      | This function reads the xyz structures from `JKCS` output. It outputs the structures as a DataFrame of ASE objects. |
| get_structure() | This function is used to choose one structure from ASE structures in order to get more relevant info from the structure. It can be used in conjunction with the `struct2img()` or `plotDescs()` functions to visualise chosen structure or its descriptors. |

### `descriptors.py`

This module is used for transforming the structures from xyz-input to a descriptor. In the beginning the descriptor hyperparameters are defined and can be tuned if necessary.

| function | description     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| setupDescs()       | This function needs the DataFrame of structures represented as ASE objects and it outputs the structures represented with the descriptors in a DataFrame. |
| plotDescs()       | This function has the same input as `setupDescs()` and it sets up the descriptors in a way suitable for plotting. The function can save the plots and show them. It will not run if parameter `pd` is set to `False`. |

### `selection.py`

This module is used for structure selection functionalities.

| function | description     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| calcKmeans()       | Runs k-means algorithm on structures. Returns a cluster labels for each structure as an array. |
| calcEAvg()       | Calculates an average energies for all clusters. Returns cluster labels and their respective anerage energies as a DataFrame. |
| getBestClusters()       | Returns the structures that belong to the best clusters. Makes a random sample if requested by parameter `r` |

### `visualize.py`

This module is used for visualisation purposes.

| function | description     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| makeDend()     | Cluster structures with hierarchical clustering and either save the dendrogram plot or show only. |
| makeTsne_2D()  | Visualise k-means results in 2D. Needs cluster labels as parameters. Can either save the plot or show only. |
| plotTsneE_3D() | Visualise k-means results with energy as z-axis. Uses plotly to make interactive plot. Can either show the plot or save it as html that can be opened later in browser |
| struct2img()   | Draw an 2D image of an ASE object. A lousy way of visualising the structures. |

### `own_colormap.py`

This module is used for defining the colors used in plotting.

| function | description     |
| :------------------ | :------------- |
| own_cmap()          | A function that defines colors to be used in plotting. Colors are chosen from [Matplotlib library](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.0/gallery/color/named_colors.html) and can be edited. The function returns a list of colornames with length of `n_clusters_init` |
| visualise_colors()  | This function provides a way of visualising the colors with a barplot. Gets number of colors as a parameter. |
