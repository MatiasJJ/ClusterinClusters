# ClusterinClusters

> Welcome to use `Clusterin'Clusters` -code! It is a program for Structure selection by k-means clustering algorithm

## Structure Selection
In configurational sampling procedure structure selection is used to reduce the amount of calculation for the next level of theory -step. This can be achieved simply by discarding some structures from the process. `ClusterinClusters` uses [k-means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) clustering for determining which structures are similar to each other. Similarity measure is Euclidian distance by default. The structures are represented as descriptors generated by the [`DScribe`-library](https://singroup.github.io/dscribe/).

## Usage:
**Standalone:**
1. Make input data in same format than the example files (or edit the `read_data()`-function in `dataio.py` to fit your data)
1. Edit the parameter input in `input4Clustering.csv`. See below for further parameter details.
1. Run `StructureSelection.py`
1. See selected structures in SelectedXXX.csv

**In JKCS**
1. Run JKCS up to part 4.
1. *Run `JKCS5_filter` with some option?*

## Input parameters
The settings for `StructureSelection.py` can be edited by editing the values in `input4Clustering.csv`.

|parameter|value|name|description|
| :------ | :-- | :- | :-------- |

|`r`|True|`sampling`|"Whether to select a random sample from the best n_clusters_out"
|`s`|20|`n_structures_out`|"Provide the number of structures = local minima outputted"
|`l`|DFT|`level`|"[XTB]/[DFT] Whether to perform selection on XTB or DFT structures"
|`e`|True|`normEd`|"Normalise energies and convert to kcal/mol"
|`v`|True|`verbose`|"Whether to print out some progress"
|`d`|MBTR|`descname`|"[CM]/[MBTR]/[SOAP] Which descriptor to use"
|`pd`|True|`plotDescs`|"Whether to plot Descriptors"
|`pc`|True|`plotClustering`|"Whether to visualize clustering results. Uses hierarchical clustering and rather greedy t-SNE"

## Main program
The main program performs all the functionalities of ClusterinClusters by calling the functions from the modules. It reads in the values `input4Clustering.csv` and passes them on to the functions as parameters.

### Outputs
The user can choose verbose on/off in `input4Clustering.csv` parameter `v` by providing `True`/`False`.

#### Plots
The program creates a folder "`plots`" for visual representation of descriptors and clustering results. User can choose not to plot descriptors or clustering with the parameters `pd` and `pc` respectively.

Clustering results are visualised using [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) and plotted both in 2D and in interactive 3D plot (`.html`) that can be opened in a browser.
**Note:** t-SNE is a rather greedy algorithm so if there's thousands of structures or time is of the essence then `pc`=`False` is recommended.

#### Selected Structures
The structures are selected from the clustering results. The code calculates mean energies for each k-means cluster and prefers the clusters with smallest mean energies. Parameter `c` defines how many of $k$ clusters are selected. If random sampling is not used, all structures that belong to the selected clusters are outputted. Random sampling takes a sample of structures from the selected clusters and outputs them. Parameter `r` defines whether random sampling is used and parameter `s` defines the size of the sample *ie.* the number of structures outputted. Random sampling is recommended when saving time and calculation resources is of interest.

The list of selected structures is outputted as `selectedXXX.csv`.
